I want to change the website to have i18n. I want the url of the site to be url/{lang} in the folder public/i18n there are json files that contains key-values for the different languages.
rename them only to be like "bg.json". So use next-intl and the build-in functionality for languages. 
Perform a request "countries" to get all the languages' flags. The response will be array of objects like {
      "id": 81,
      "name": "Italy",
      "code": "IT",
      "flag": "https://kmp-admin.perspectiveunity.com/flags/it.png",
}. 
Use those flags in the select dropdown, which will be placed top right.
When choosing an item from the dropdown, change the url to the corresponding language.
Make the bg language default and preserve user's choice in localStorage.
